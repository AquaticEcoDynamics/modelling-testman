<h1>Module 5: Catchment Water Balance</h1>
<div id="M5_2" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<p>To understand a simple multi-store catchment water balance model and implement within Excel or R. Using the supplied parameters and input data, run the model and plot the variability in key hydrological pathways.</p>
</div>
<div id="M5_3" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>The Water Balance Approach</h3>
<p>A water balance equation can be used to describe the flow of water in and out of a “system”. A system can be one of several hydrological domains depending on the context, such as a column of soil or a catchment basin. In the context of catchment, we assume the catchment area has a known ‘average’ depth, and the amount of soil is the catchment area multiplied by the depth. We treat this soil volume as our catchment ‘bucket’, and then estimate the inputs (rainfall) and outputs (evapotranspiration, runoff and baseflow).</p>
<p>Based on our understanding of soil physics, flow processes and transpiration, we can further partition water within the bucket into different sub-compartments. In this exercise we assume the catchment bucket can include a saturated and unsaturated layer, and even an optional deeper groundwater system.</p>
<p>The water balance assumes an initial amount of water and then we sequentially estimate the fluxes of water as outlined below in the conceptual diagram.</p>

<h3>Module resources</h3>
<p>Download the Excel spreadsheet and R files for this module by clicking the download button in the tool bar <i class="fa fa-download" aria-hidden="true"></i>.</p>

<div class="rmdnote2">
You can use either Excel or R for this module.
</div>
</div>
<div id="M5_4" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Water Balance Model</h3>
<p>Open the spreadsheet or RStudio project. Make sure that there are three sections in each: Inputs, Equations and Plotting. Draw your own version of the diagram above, label all of the variables and note the storage, evaporation and flows.</p>
<div id="M5_5" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Date</h4>
<p>Have a quick look at the date.</p>
<p>In Excel, the date takes the first four columns of the Equations sheet.</p>
<p>In RStudio, there is a section in the Inputs script called <code>#DATE</code>. Run the section line by line and you
will learn how to make dates. Then delete the comments at the end of the section.</p>
</div>
<div id="M5_6" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Climate</h4>
<p>As boundary conditions, we have a precipitation dataset, and a function (Equation <a href="M5-1.html#eq:module5-28">(50)</a>) to simulate potential evaporation (Figure <a href="M5-1.html#fig:module5-fig1">5</a>).</p>
<p>In Excel, the precipitation is in a column and has a value for every date. The potential evaporation is given by a sin wave function that makes potential evaporation increase in summer and decrease in winter. Copy this formula down the page.</p>
<p>In RStudio, the rainfall is given by a text file ’Precipitation.txt’. You will have to download this text file, tell RStudio the location where you have saved the data, and then load the data into your project. Finally, in the equations, you can convert the precipitation dataset into a matrix.
The parameters for the potential evaporation function are in Inputs, and the equation is in the Equations script. Look for the <code>#CLIMATE FORCING</code> sections.</p>

<h4>Storage</h4>
<p>Start to write in the equations for storage, using the equations given in the <a href="M5-1.html#M5_12">Equations</a> section of this module. Note that there are two variables that have a prime (<span class="math inline">\(\prime\)</span>) sign. These variables only exist theoretically in the model, so that we can use them for our IF statements.</p>

<div class="rmdtip2">
You may have to convert between storage volumes (m<sup>3</sup>) and heights (m) by multiplying or dividing by area (m<sup>2</sup>).
</div>
<p>In Excel, there is an initial condition in a box given for you at time step 0. Your equations will start at time step 1. Your whole set of equations will not be finished until you have also completed the evaporation and flows, but you have to start somewhere.</p>
<p>In RStudio, the initial condition is given in the <code>Inputs</code> section with the square brackets and the <code>[1]</code> (time step 1) and the loop starts at time step 2. For the equations, use the sequence that is given. The code reads from top to bottom so it is important that if a variable is referred to in an equation, it must already have been calculated in a previous line of code. Pay careful attention to the indices for <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t-1\)</span>.</p>

<div class="rmdtip2">
<p>In Excel, the timestep advances as you go down the page. The notation <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> could refer to any timestep, with <span class="math inline">\(t-1\)</span> simply being the timestep before <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(t+1\)</span> being the timestep after <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>.</p>
<p>If an equation is written entirely in terms of <span class="math inline">\(t+1\)</span> (e.g. <span class="math inline">\(X^{t+1}= Y^{t+1}+Z^{t+1}\)</span>), it can be simplified to be written just in terms of <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> (e.g. <span class="math inline">\(X^{t}= Y^{t}+Z^{t}\)</span>). This is because <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is arbitrary and we’re just referring to the same timestep for the entire equation.</p>

<h4>Maximum Storage Capacity of the Bucket/Catchment</h4>

</center>
<p>The theoretical maximum storage capacity of the catchment is calculated by taking the difference between the porosity of the catchment soil (i.e. a measure of the total pore space in the soil, and hence, its ability to store water) and the permanent wilting point of the soil (the point at which volumetric water content is too low to be extracted from the soil by plants) and multiplying it by the volume of the catchment (i.e. surface area multiplied by the depth of the catchment). Note that <span class="math inline">\(S_{max}\)</span> is the sum of <span class="math inline">\(S_{us}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(S_{sat}\)</span>, and does not include <span class="math inline">\(S_{gw}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Note that ‘plant available water’ is the water content difference between field capacity and permanent wilting point of the soil at any given depth.</p>

<h4>Threshold Storage</h4>

f_c=\ \left(\frac{\theta_{fc}-\ \theta_{pwp}}{\varphi-\ \theta_{pwp}}\right)
\tag{30}
\end{equation}\]</span>
</center>
<p>Field capacity is the point at which all pore space small enough to retain water against the pull of gravity are filled (Brady and Weil, 1999). It is essentially the remaining water content of the soil after the removal of water by the downward forces of gravity over a daily time period. Field capacity therefore assumes that the water removed from the soil profile is only removed by gravity, not through plant suction or evaporation. The above formula calculates the threshold storage parameter as the proportion of ‘plant available water’ over storage capacity of the soil at any given depth.</p>

<span class="math display" id="eq:module5-3">\[\begin{equation}
S_{fc}=\ S_{max} f_c
\tag{31}

<p>The volumetric water storage at field capacity is therefore the theoretical maximum storage capacity of the catchment multiplied (or limited by) the threshold storage parameter (which is ≤ 1).</p>

Precipitation recorded in the previous time step (inflow) is added to the initial storage value, whilst total evapotranspiration and total runoff in the previous time step (outflows) are both subtracted. Total water storage is made up of water stored in the saturated and unsaturated zones. Note that the initial value of <span class="math inline">\(S_{tot}\)</span> may be empirically determined or assumed to be a certain value.

<p>The daily recharge rate from the unsaturated zone to the saturated zone is calculated as water storage in the unsaturated zone in the present time step, in addition to precipitation that has occurred in the current time step, less the threshold storage of the unsaturated zone (i.e. water which does not drain due to the downward forces of gravity alone).

<h4>Agricultural/Shallow Root Crop Evapotranspiration</h4>
<p>For evapotranspiration by agricultural crops, we make the assumption that they can draw water from the unsaturated zone only, thus:</p>
<!-- <center> -->
<!-- \begin{equation} -->
<!-- e_{ag} = \left\{\begin{matrix} C\alpha_{eag}\left[\frac{S_{us}}{S_{max}-\ S_{sat}}\right]e_p,\ \ &S_{sat}<\varphi D_{eag} -->
<!-- \\C\alpha_{eag}\left[\frac{S_{us}+\ \left(S_{sat}-\ \varphi D_{eag}\right)}{S_{sat}-\ \varphi D_{eag}}\right]e_p,\ \ &S_{sat}\geq\varphi D_{eag} -->
<!-- \end{matrix}\right. -->
<!-- (\#eq:module5-17) -->
<!-- \end{equation} -->
<!-- </center> -->
<!-- In the first case, the water table is below the maximum depth of influence of agricultural crops, and total $e_{ag}$ is thus assumed to come from the unsaturated zone. Whereas in the second case, the water table is above the maximum depth of influence, meaning that $e_{ag}$ will be drawn partially from both the saturated and unsaturated zones.  -->
<!-- In the first case therefore, $e_{ag}$ is calculated as the % of agricultural crop cover in the catchment, multiplied by the agricultural scaling factor (effectively an efficiency parameter), multiplied by the fraction of water stored in the unsaturated zone over the maximum potential water storage within that zone (a limiting variable), multiplied by the potential ET. -->
<!-- In the second case, the fraction is amended to be the sum of the water stored in both the saturated and unsaturated zones within the depth of influence over the proportion that falls below the water table.  -->
